                  <h2>Solution</h2>
                  <p>To address this issue, we have developed a food recipe generator that uses food images to suggest recipes. The system uses deep learning algorithms to analyze the food images and generate a list of ingredients that can be used to create a recipe. The system also takes into account dietary restrictions and preferences. </p>
